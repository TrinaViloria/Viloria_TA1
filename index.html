                    <p>This is my personal blog where I share information about myself.</p>  
                    <p> My name is <b>Trina Marielle Viloria</b>, currently 20 years old, born on November 9, 2005.</p> 
                    <p> My favorite color is pink. In my free time, I enjoy binge watching different movies and series. I also enjoy reading fiction books. In both hobbies, I prefer the genre, thriller or mystery.</p> 
                    <p> I love expressing myself through photography and I enjoy documenting my life. </p>
                    <p> Through this blog, I'll be sharing about a few details of my life, specifically, as a student, a family member, and a friend. I'll also be sharing the best places I've visited in our country, the Philippines.</p>
